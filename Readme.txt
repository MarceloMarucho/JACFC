.:: INTRODUCTION ::.

JACFC is a Java GUI application  that provides both
experts and non-experts in the field suitable tools for elucidating the molecular mechanisms
modulating the electrical signal propagation, stability, and bundle formation of microtubules
and actin filaments under different molecular (wild type, isoforms, mutants) and environ-
mental (physiological and pathological) conditions. This acknowledgement might reveal
the potential role of cytoskeleton filaments in neuronal activities, including molecular-level
processing of information and neural regeneration. Molecular understanding of the poly-
electrolyte properties of bionanowires, is also crucial for development of reliability, highly
functioning small devices with biotechnological applications such as bionanosensors and com-
puting bionanoprocessors.

JACFC is potentially useful for studying cytoskeleton filaments. 

Users are recommended to run JACFC online from the website http://neuronanobiophysics.utsa.edu/ where they can find tutorial videos, user guides, examples, and a discussion forum.

Otherwise, users can download the Linux desktop version from this repository to the user's computer and run it locally.
In this case, the user has to open a terminal. change the current directory to the ~/JACFC/dist/ directory and run the following command line

java -jar JACFC-multiuser.jar

The GUI will open the main window screen.

.:: DEPENDENCIES ::.

- No external library / application dependences are required to run the software.


.:: EXAMPLES & DOCUMENTATION ::.

JACFC comes with a User's Guides. The user can access these pdf files using the graphical user interface under the "Help" menu.


.:: SUPPORT ::.
