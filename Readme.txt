.:: INTRODUCTION ::.

JACFC is a Java GUI application  that provides both
experts and non-experts in the field suitable tools for elucidating the molecular mechanisms
modulating the electrical signal propagation, stability, and bundle formation of microtubules
and actin filaments under different molecular (wild type, isoforms, mutants) and environ-
mental (physiological and pathological) conditions. This acknowledgement might reveal
the potential role of cytoskeleton filaments in neuronal activities, including molecular-level
processing of information and neural regeneration. Molecular understanding of the poly-
electrolyte properties of bionanowires, is also crucial for development of reliability, highly
functioning small devices with biotechnological applications such as bionanosensors and com-
puting bionanoprocessors.

.:: DEPENDENCIES ::.

- No external library / application dependences are required to run the software.

.:: DOCUMENTATION ::.

-Instructions to run the Web application version

Users are recommended to run JACFC online from the website http://neuronanobiophysics.utsa.edu/ where they can find tutorial videos, user guides, examples, and a discussion forum.

- Instructions to run the Desktop version included in the folder "JACFC" (https://github.com/MarceloMarucho/JACFC)

1- You need LINUX operating system and JAVA installed on your personal computer in order to run the GUI JAVA desktop application.

2- Open a terminal in your personal computer. Change the current directory to "~/JACFC/dist". For instance, if you have saved the folder "JACFC" in your home directory, then you have to type in the terminal the following command line

>cd $HOME/JACFC/dist

3- Then, run the command line

>java -jar "JACFC-multiuser.jar"

The GUI will open the main window screen. The user can access the User's Guides using the graphical user interface under the "Help" menu.

-Relevant subfolders saved in folder JACFC

JACFC_Workspace (folder that keep a copy of all the simulation results. For each simulation, JACFC creates a new folder in the directory "JACFC_Workspace" including the output files generated by the simulation for post analysis purpose. The corresponding folder name is the simulation day and time)
3v  (It contains the libraries, Fortran and Python source files downloaded from the repository “svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/vossvolvox/code/ vossvolvox/”, as well as, compiled Fortran and Python applications required to run the 3v program, version 1.2. It is used by the Stability and Aggregation module).
jmol  (It contains the jmol.jar java application, version 13, downloaded from the sourceforge website  “http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/latest/download?source=files” for protein visualization. It is used by the Stability and Aggregation module)
pdb2pqr (It contains the libraries and source files downloaded from the sourceforce website “https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdb2pqr/files/latest/download”, as well as, compiled Fortran and Python applications required to run pdb2pqr and propka applications. It is used by the Stability and Aggregation module)
pdbfiles  (It contains two uncharged molecular structures for illustration purposes. 1dna.pdb and 1J6Z.pdb represent a cylindrical biomolecule and a globular protein example, respectively. This folder can be used by the user to save any other molecular structure. It is used by the Stability and Aggregation module)
provol  (It contains the Trove collections library and the ProteinVolume.jar java application downloaded from the website “http://gmlab.bio.rpi.edu/download.php”.  ProteinVolume.jar is required to run the provol program, version 1.3. It is used by the Stability and Aggregation module).
Linux (It contains statically compiled and portable Fortran applications required to run the JACFC and perform some GUI operations).
dist (It contains the compiled JACFC-multiuser.jar file and the corresponding java libraries required to run the GUI).
build (It contains figure and image files required by the GUI to illustrate different methods and options).
src (Java script source files associated with the GUI. It includes the subfolders Classes, Forms, Images, jmolapp, Procedures, and Splash)
